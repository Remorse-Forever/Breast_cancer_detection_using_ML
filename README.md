# Breast_cancer_detection_using_ML

- This is a project to detect breast cancer using Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset used in
this project is the Wisconsin Diabetes Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original)).
The goal of this project is to build an ML model that can accurately classify whether
a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features such as texture, perimeter,
compactness, etc.
# Steps involved:
1. Import necessary libraries and load data
2. Preprocess data (normalize, encode categorical variables)
3. Split data into training set and test set
4. Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier)
5. Evaluate models' performance (accuracy score, confusion matrix, ROC curve)
6. Select best performing model for further analysis
7. Analyze results with visualizations (heatmap, bar chart, scatter plot)
8. Prepare final report with conclusions and recommendations
9. Present findings through presentation slides
